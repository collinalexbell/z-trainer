## Minimal Viable Increment 
When my dog walks up to the Kuberdog Chrysalis

## Motivations
 Onix, the daemon, is going to train my dog as one of its skills. My dog gets bored when I am hacking, which used to be very frequently, less so now that I have my dog. Thats the problem. I need to keep my dog occupied so I can hack more. True story.
